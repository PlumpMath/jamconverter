easy stuff:
* ?=
* () in conditions
* && || in conditions
* !=
* quote \\ character in lexer
* rules that specify no arguments, but use $(<) and $(>) for arguments one and two.
* remaining variable expansion modifiers
* implement W32_GETREG
* implement GroupByVar

lotsofwork stuff:

hard stuff:

include statement
splitting includes etc over multiple c# files

variable scoping:
* on {} support in converter
* local
